# .shellcheckrc - Project-level configuration for ShellCheck
#
# Reference:
#   https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/Directive
#
# Rationale:
#   gex intentionally sources scripts whose paths are resolved at runtime and
#   may live outside the current directory (for plugin extensibility). This
#   triggers SC1090/SC1091 (can't follow non-constant source). We disable them
#   globally to avoid annotating every dynamic 'source' line.
#
#   Some warnings are conditionally useful but noisy for this project style.
#   Keep the excluded list as small as possible; revisit periodically.

# Disabled checks (space/comma separated is allowed; we use commas for clarity)
# SC1090 / SC1091: dynamic or non-constant source paths (plugin architecture)
# SC2155: command substitution in declare/assignment (occasionally used for brevity)
# SC2317: unreachable code (false positives in set -e + trap patterns)
# SC2034: unused variables (sometimes used for documentation / future use markers)
exclude=SC1090,SC1091,SC2155,SC2317,SC2034

# Optional: set severity threshold (style > info > warning > error)
# uncomment to hide purely stylistic suggestions
# severity=warning

# Source path hints (can help if you vendor external libs later)
# source-path=/usr/local/lib:/opt/scripts

# Enable external sources following if you later vendor dependencies
# follow-sources=yes

# Colorized output (ShellCheck CLI flag can override)
# color=auto
